--- BlenderDragonframe MOCO Data ---

The app convert Kyeframe data from Blender to Dragonframe Motion Control Module (ARC MOCO).

Exist a Pyhton alternative from GITHUB (Blender Addon) but have bugs and the bezier interpretation distort the movement in Dragronframe finally.

This first release function with linear interpolation, constant movement. That limits
the possible Cinematography but also give possibilities into the limits, as other applied arts.
